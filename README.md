To play around open dev-tools console (`F12`) and use the `draw(width, height, limit, rmin, rmax, imin, imax, hueMin, hueMax)` function for rendering new frames manually, also see `global.var.scale` for resolution.

Defaults are `draw(10, 10, 40, -2, 0.6, -1.3, 1.3, -1.4, -0.8)` and `global.var.scale = 0.25` (25% window size).
